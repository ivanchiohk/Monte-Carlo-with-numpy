### Two Montel Carlo examples with numpy

The Monte Carlo method is a technique for numerical approximating quantities that are hard to compute or having no closed-form answer. The basic idea comes from the law of large numbers. 

Here we use numpy to demonstrate the Monte Carlo method by two examples, one using the uniform distribution, and the other one using the exponential distribution.
