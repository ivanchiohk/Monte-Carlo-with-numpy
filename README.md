### Montel Carlo examples with numpy

The Monte Carlo method is a technique for numerically approximating quantities that are hard to compute or having no closed-form answer. The basic idea comes from the law of large numbers: if we repeatedly draw random samples according to an underlying distribution, the average output will be a good unbiased estimator of the expected value.

Here we use numpy to demonstrate the Monte Carlo method by three examples.
